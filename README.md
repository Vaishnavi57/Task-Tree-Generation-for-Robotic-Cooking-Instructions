Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented algorithms to parse unstructured inputs into structured, reusable task trees.
Applied object-oriented programming principles to define functional units with clear input/output states and motion nodes.
Developed and optimized JSON-based output formats to ensure scalability and performance.
Utilized debugging tools and profilers to enhance system performance during development.
Compared multiple design approaches, analyzed their pros/cons, and reported on performance metrics to ensure efficient task tree generation.
Technologies and Tools: Python, object-oriented programming, JSON, Gemini LLM, IDEs, debugging tools.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Strong object-oriented design and analytical skills.
Proficiency with tools such as IDEs and profilers.
Experience with designing scalable, reusable systems.
